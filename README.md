# Flower-Recognition-with-CNN-
Flower Recognition using custom CNN.

This project is based on the dataset gathered from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

This project shows thhe basic concept of interpreting with unstructured data stored in files rather than in any tables.


This project can be solved in kagle notebooks. 
Here's the link of symmetrical project on this dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/sagnik1511/flower-recognition-93-accuracy-with-neural-nets

API link of the dataset which is needed if anybody want to use the data without downloading it :

Language Used :     Python 3.7.2

                 
Approach :       

                 1. Fetching data and unzipping
                 2. Reshaping and rescaling the data to create dataframes
                 3. Visualization
                 4. Model Building
                 5. Model Fit and Prediction
                 6. Conclusion
       


Model Used :     
            
            Sequential ( Conv2D , Dense , Dropout , Flatten )

Conclusion :     Rather than having only the model predictive values we can find out some different conclusions about the biological correlation of the flowers.
