# Flower-Recognition-with-CNN-
Using Convolutional Neural Network to predict flowers from 5 different types.

This project is based on the dataset gathered from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

This project shows thhe basic concept of interpreting with unstructured data stored in files rather than in any tables.

Language Used :     Python 3.7.2

Libraries Used : 

                 1. tensorflow
                 2. pandas
                 3. numpy
                 4. matplotlib
                 5. os
                 6. sklearn
                 7. skimage
                 
Approach :       

                 1. Fetching data and unzipping
                 2. Reshaping and rescaling the data to create dataframes
                 3. Visualization
                 4. Model Building
                 5. Model Fit and Prediction
                 6. Conclusion
       


Model Used :     
            
            Sequential ( Conv2D , Dense , Dropout , Flatten )

Conclusion :     Rather than having only the model predictive values we can find out some different conclusions about the biological correlation of the flowers.

This project can be solved in kagle notebooks.
